the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much
fruit." The slowness and smallness of this kind of ministry requires a
certain kind of gospel imaginary from those who pastor here. It’s the
kind of imaginary Wendell Berry calls for in his poem Manifesto: The
Mad Farmer Liberation Front:
