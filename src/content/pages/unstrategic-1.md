heading: Jesus is decidedly unstrategic.
---

He came to the sound of angels singing and then spent the next thirty
years learning carpentry. Even during his public ministry, he spent
most of his time going at a slow pace in a small place. This is
unstrategic not because there was no plan, but because the plan
doesn’t make sense! Yet the madness of this plan is exactly how God
chose to display the upside-down nature of his Kingdom. Jesus won by
dying. Jesus chose two women to witness the resurrection. Jesus built
his church on the preaching of one of his betrayers. Jesus' plan is
beautiful—but mad. <span class="text-accent">
Trusting him takes imagination.
